<H2><b> COVID-19 Community Explorer</b> </H2> <Hr>
The <b>COVID-19 Community Explorer</b> provides a simple way to explore geographic clusters of county-communities affected by the pandemic and their socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related features. <br>
  <br> Using machine learning techniques, the counties are clustered into <b>8 community profiles</B>:
 <br><b>1</b> - the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (38% US population)
<br><b>2</b> - highly educated, economically prosperous, mostly White counties in metro areas. (25% US population)
<br><b>3</b> - the largest Black population, whose income is the lowest income of all the profiles. These counties are primarily concentrated in the south-east. (12% US population)
<br><b>4</b> - the largest white population with the lowest income of all the profiles. It encompasses mostly rural counties in the East North Central, and Northeast regions. (7% US population))
<br><b>5</b> - predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> - the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> - the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> - the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>

You can filter the counties shown on the map by profile by using the drop-down. You can also select a specific underlying health conditions: select the health condition of interest in the dropdown menu and adjust the sliders to filter counties by their prevalence of that condition.

 Because minimum and maximum prevalence rates vary by condition, changing the health condition might cause it to appear as though some or even all counties have disappeared. This is usually because the maximum or minimum value of the prior health condition observed is much higher or lower than those of the currently observed condition. Adjusting the slider should cause all counties to reappear (if the maximum of the new health condition is lower than the minimum of the prior health condition, slide the minimum up and then back down). 
 “Null” is the categorization for Kansas City and Joplin, MO, whose COVID-19 information is reported at the city level.
