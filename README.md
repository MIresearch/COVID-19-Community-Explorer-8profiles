<H2><b> COVID-19 Community Explorer</b> </H2> <Hr>
The <b>COVID-19 Community Explorer</b> is an interactive map that provides a simple way to explore geographic clusters of communities affected by the pandemic and their socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related features. <br>
  <br> Using machine learning techniques, the counties are clustered into <b>8 community profiles</B>:
 <br><b>1</b> - the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (38% US population)
<br><b>2</b> - highly educated, economically prosperous, mostly White counties in metro areas. (25% US population)
<br><b>3</b> - the largest Black population, whose income is the lowest income of all the profiles. These counties are primarily concentrated in the south-east. (12% US population)
<br><b>4</b> - the largest white population with the lowest income of all the profiles. It encompasses mostly rural counties in the East North Central, and Northeast regions. (7% US population))
<br><b>5</b> - predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> - the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> - the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> - the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>

<H2>US Counties Communities </H2>

<H2>Most Affected Communities in Terms of Population Adjusted Death Rate </H2>
These 100 counties make up about 9% of the population and account for 47% of all COVID-19 deaths and 36% of all confirmed and suspected cases. Controlling for the population size allows us to compare and contrast counties based on the other dimensions (health, social, demographic, economic, etc).

<H2>Key Health and Social Characteristics of The Most and Least Affected Counties  </H2>
